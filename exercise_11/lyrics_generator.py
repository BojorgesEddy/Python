That's the price you pay
Leave behind your heart and cast away
Just another product of today
Rather be the hunter than the prey
And you're standing on the edge face up
'Cause you're a natural
A beating heart of stone
You gotta be so cold
To make it in this world
Yeah, you're a natural
Living your life cutthroat
You gotta be so cold
Yeah, you're a natural
Will somebody
Let me see the light within the dark trees shadowing?
What's happening?
Looking through the glass find the wrong within the past knowing
Oh, we are the youth
Cut until it bleeds inside a world without the peace, face it
A bit of the truth, the truth
That's the price you pay
Leave behind your heart and cast away
Just another product of today

Yeah, you're a natural
Living your life cutthroat
You gotta be so cold
Yeah, you're a natural
Deep inside me, I'm fading to black, I'm fading
Took an oath by the blood on my hand, won't break it
I can taste it, the end is upon us, I swear
Gonna make it
I'm gonna make it
Natural

You gotta be so cold
To make it in this world
Yeah, you're a natural
Living your life cutthroat
You gotta be so cold

Take me down to the fighting end

Past the black where the sirens sing
Warm me up in a nova's glow
And drop me down to the dream below
'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass
Hardly anything there for you to see
For you to see
Bring me home in a blinding dream
Through the secrets that I have seen
Wash the sorrow from off my skin

It seems what's left of my human side
Is slowly changing in me

Looking at my own reflection
When suddenly it changes
Violently it changes (oh no)
There is no turning back now
You've woken up the demon in me

You fucker get up come on get down with the sickness
Madness is the gift, that has been given to me
I can see inside you, the sickness is rising
Don't try to deny what you feel
(Will you give in to me?)
It seems that all that was good has died
And is decaying in me
(Will you give in to me?)
It seems you're having some trouble
In dealing with these changes
Living with these changes (oh no)
The world is a scary place
Now that you've woken up the demon in me

I'll be a good boy, I promise
No mommy don't hit me
Why did you have to hit me like that, mommy?
Don't do it, you're hurting me
Why did you have to be such a bitch
Why don't you
Why don't you just fuck off and die
Why can't you just fuck off and die
Why can't you just leave here and die
Never stick your hand in my face again bitch

seizeTheDay = '''Seize the day or die regretting the time you lost
It's empty and cold without you here, too many people to ache over

But I'm too young to worry
These streets we travel on
Will undergo our same lost past
I found you here, now please just stay for a while
I can move on with you around
I hand you my mortal life, but will it be forever?
I'd do anything for a smile
Holding you 'til our time is done
We both know the day will come
But I don't want to leave you
I see my vision burn
I feel my memories fade with time
But I'm too young to worry
A melody, a memory, or just one picture
Seize the day or die regretting the time you lost
It's empty and cold without you here, too many people to ache over
Newborn life replacing all of us
Changing this fable we live in
No longer needed here so where do we go?
Will you take a journey tonight, follow me past the walls of death?
But girl, what if there is no eternal life?
I see my vision burn
I feel my memories fade with time
But I'm too young to worry
A melody, a memory, or just one picture
Seize the day or die regretting the time you lost
It's empty and cold without you here, too many people to ache over
Trials in life, questions of us existing here
Don't wanna die alone without you here
Please tell me what we have is real
So, what if I never hold you, yeah
Or kiss your lips again?
Woah, so I never want to leave you
And the memories of us to see I beg don't leave me
Seize the day or die regretting the time you lost
It's empty and cold without you here, too many people to ache over
Trials in life, questions of us existing here
Don't wanna die alone without you here
Please tell me what we have is real
Silence you lost me, no chance for one more day
Silence you lost me, no chance for one more day [then continues in the background]

To never count on you
I'm only down for you
We pretty down, baby, well, I, I
She wanna fuck a nigga like she love me
She got a lover, but I might get lucky
But you got me on a drain like a drunkie
Looking at the junk in your trunk like a junkie
We don't speak, just fuck a twice a week
And if she like freaks, we must try a threesome
Do it on the beach, in the sand, let me see some'
Seashells on the shore, I'm a beach bum
Finna eat some' when you come
Baby, don't you wanna let me know?
Laying on my bed like a vegetable
Lied when you said, "Never let me go"
Just like a pole, you professional
Stand on your hand 'cause you flexible
Now she tryna fuck me in the restroom or the parking lot
At the restaurant, anywhere, everywhere, anytime, I
I don't need loving, late-night cuffing
Take it all off, you naughty
Put it back on and pause it
Kitchen, island, bedroom, closet
Takin' that elsewhere, maybe
We know we both got options
I don't need loving, late-night cuffing
Take it all off, you naughty
Put it back on and pause it

'Cause I came in this bitch and I'm lookin' for a body (ayy, ayy, wait, wait)
I feel like murder is a motherfuckin' hobby
And I'm comin' off the top, feelin' like I'm Jeff Hardy
Got blood on the dance floor, walk up in this party
Blood on my shirt from the vendetta
Stomp him in the face with my boot and I tell him, "Get up"
Bitch, heads up, I'm gettin' fed up
Pull up with the gun and mark yo' head up, bitch

Monsters who will not show themselves, and who cause trouble
Monsters who abduct children
Monsters who devour dreams
Monsters who suck blood
And monsters who always tell lies

Can't see where I'm at
Driftin' through the rain
Dark tint matte black
What the fuck do you want?
Bitch, shut the fuck up, I'm relaxed
I ain't tryna fuck with you or your bros
Bitch, you are a broke bitch
Put in the work bitch
You gon' stay homeless

This is my perfect victory
